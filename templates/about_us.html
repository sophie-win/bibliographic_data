        style="margin-right: 10px;"/>
    <p class="fh5co_consectetur">Phu Wai graduated from University of Technology (Yatanarpon Cyber City), Myanmar, with a Bachelor of Engineering
        (Information Science and Technology) in February 2019.  She was an outstanding student, and obtained an almost
        perfect GPA score there.  After graduation, she worked at Concordia International as a web developer from

        Selenium and JMeter software to apply on Laboratory Information System (LIS) project which is to interface with
        laboratory equipment without manually.
    While working, Phu Wai realized how important it was to realise the synergy between information technology and
        business, and decided to further her studies at the Nanyang Technological University.  She began studying in
        Master of Science (Information Systems) programme at NTU, Singapore in July 2019.

    <p class="fh5co_heading" style="padding-top: 10px">About Albert Leng</p>
    <img src="../static/img/albert.png" align="left" width="200" height="150"/>
    <p class="fh5co_consectetur">Albert graduated from University of Tasmania with a
        bachelor’s
        degree in Computer Sytems Engineering in 2002. Since then, Albert has been doing end-to-end software
        development in various fields, managing multiple projects from conceptualization
        to deployment. As a lifelong learner with insatiable thirst for knowledge and skills particularly in IT,
        Albert embarked on his journey in Master of Science (Information System)
        programme at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU).
    </p>
    <p class="fh5co_consectetur">
        During his leisure times, Albert enjoys spending time bonding with his beloved family, including performing
        playful antics in front of his newborn baby boy. Being an avid music lover,
        he used to perform and sing with rock bands. He even dreamt of releasing his own albums but alas, that
        remained just a dream. When he was younger, Albert used to think that wasn’t
        cool to go to bed by 10 p.m. and to wake up early the next day. He is somewhat older and wiser now, and is
        proud to be that guy he never thought he would become.</p>
    <p class="fh5co_consectetur">
        In this project, Albert is responsible for deployment for the web application and Neo4j database on Virtual
        Private Server (VPS). He also explored how graph databases like Neo4j
        can be applicable to use cases which benefit the industry and business to provide greater value. He is
        looking into the possibility of enhancement of the web application in terms
        of security and latency.
