                    a Bachelor of Engineering
                    (Information Science and Technology) in February 2019. She was an outstanding student, and obtained
                    an
                    almost
                    perfect GPA score there. After graduation, she worked at Concordia International as a web developer
                    from
                    January 2019 to May 2019. During her short stint there, Phu Wai got some knowledge in software
                    testing using
                    Selenium and JMeter software to apply on Laboratory Information System (LIS) project which is to

                    laboratory equipment without manually.
                    While working, Phu Wai realized how important it was to realise the synergy between information
                    technology
                    and
                    business, and decided to further her studies at the Nanyang Technological University. She began

                <p class="fh5co_consectetur">Albert graduated from University of Tasmania with a
                    bachelor’s
                    degree in Computer Sytems Engineering in 2002. Since then, Albert has been doing end-to-end software
                    development in various fields, managing multiple projects from conceptualization
                    to deployment. As a lifelong learner with insatiable thirst for knowledge and skills particularly in
                    IT,
                    Albert embarked on his journey in Master of Science (Information System)
                    programme at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

                <p class="fh5co_consectetur">
                    During his leisure times, Albert enjoys spending time bonding with his beloved family, including
                    performing
                    playful antics in front of his newborn baby boy. Being an avid music lover,
                    he used to perform and sing with rock bands. He even dreamt of releasing his own albums but alas,
                    that
                    remained just a dream. When he was younger, Albert used to think that wasn’t
                    cool to go to bed by 10 p.m. and to wake up early the next day. He is somewhat older and wiser now,
                    and is
                    proud to be that guy he never thought he would become.</p>
                <p class="fh5co_consectetur">
                    In this project, Albert is responsible for deployment for the web application and Neo4j database on
                    Virtual
                    Private Server (VPS). He also explored how graph databases like Neo4j
                    can be applicable to use cases which benefit the industry and business to provide greater value. He
                    is
                    looking into the possibility of enhancement of the web application in terms
                    of security and latency.

            <p>An ideal technical CI project should achieve the following five objectives:</p>
            <ol>
                <li> students should learn things about information technology that are completely new to them (i.e., things that have not been taught in the programme)</li>
                    <p>One of the objectives of the MSc (Knowledge Management) programme is for students to learn how to continue to learn throughout their lifetime.
                        The pace of change and development in information technology is such that the students who aspire to work in this field must be especially adept
                        in being nimble and fast learners.</p>
                    <p>In this project, the students have learnt the following languages / frameworks:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>Django</li>
                        <li>Neo4j and Cypher</li>
                        <li> D3 and Neo4jD3</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>They also learnt the following, in greater depth:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> the Font Awesome font and icon toolkit</li>
                        <li>the Bootstrap framework</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <li>students should experience the issues and problems faced with deploying the website with an actual host</li>
                    <p>Making a project work on a local server is very different from making one work on a host.
                        There are lots of settings on both the internet domain registrar, and the hosting service.
                        There are problems to be sorted out with the hosting service.  All of which students do not get
                        to experience with when working on a project hosted locally.</p>
                    <p>In this project, the students have deployed the entire website in Digital Ocean.</p>
                <li>students should be able to give a demonstration of their project when they go for interviews</li>
                    <p>After completion of the programme, most students will go for job interviews, and during the interviews,
                        they will inevitably be asked about the project they had worked on.  Providing a demonstration of the app is the tangible
                        prove the they have worked on it.  Unfortunately many student projects lie dormant in GitHub or some other code repository.
                        As a result, they can only talk about their projects during interview, and perhaps show a few screen shots.  By deploying it
                        for at least a year, students can show off their projects during their interviews.  The hyperlink to their LinkedIn pages in
                        the About Page assures the interviewer that the job applicant has indeed worked on the project, and being able to explore
                        the app in their own time enables the interviewer to see that the project actually works.</p>
                <li>students should learn something outside information technology</li>
                    <p>In the genogram portion of this project, data from the Darwin-Wedgwood family tree was used.
                        Students learn about three eminent members of this family (1) Charles Robert Darwin; (2) Francis Galton; and (3) Ralph Vaughan Williams.</p>
                <li>students should learn the concept of productive struggle</li>
                    <p>Productive struggle refers to  the process of effortful learning that helps students develops grit and creative problem solving.
                        When students face problems they don’t immediately know how to solve a problem, we don't want them to give up.</p>
            </ol>
            <p>This project provided many problems which students had to overcome.  I hope it has increased their “grittiness”, and creative problem solving skills.</p>
